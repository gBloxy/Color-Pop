# Color Pop

Color Pop is a little game where you need to select the same color as a falling shape before it reaches the bottom of the screen. When a shape reaches the end and the selected color doesn't matchâ€‹, you lose a life. The shapes spawn and move faster and faster.  
The game features a global online leaderboard for high scores.  While needing no account or sign-up, it lets anyone submit their score.
